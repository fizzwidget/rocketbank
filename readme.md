## Introduction

<<Clever intro pending>>

Built with spare parts from official bank machinery certified by the Undermine Cartels, the Stormwind Counting House, and SOMETHING HORDE -- so it's familiar and easy to use, and easy to keep compatible as those systems change!

## Features

    - bags
    - bank 
    - gold
    - TODO guild bank
    - TODO equipped inventory
    - TODO currency

    - For crafting reagents with quality levels, counts and summarizes all qualities

    - TODO currency
