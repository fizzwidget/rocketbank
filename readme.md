## Introduction

<<Clever intro pending>>

Built with spare parts from official bank machinery certified by the Undermine Cartels, the Stormwind Counting House, and the Horde Treasury -- so it's familiar and easy to use, and easy to keep compatible as those systems change!

## Features

- Remembers what items and money each of your characters has in:
    - bags & equipped inventory
    - bank 
    - guild bank
    - warband bank
    
- Item tooltips show how many of that item you have, and where
    - For crafting reagents with quality levels, counts and summarizes all qualities

- Bank panel to show the cached contents of your (and your alts') bank, bags, gold, etc
    - Search field integrated with base UI bank/bag search, searches across characters
    - Open the bank panel with `/bank`, minimap addon compartment, or key binding
    
- Is neither a conspiracy to embezzle from faction governments nor a rocketway construction scheme to exploit settlers looking for housing in new lands
