## Introduction

There's a lot of stuff for an adventurer to keep track of these days, huh? Especially when you and your pals really get going with those "warband" timeshare deals. That's where this amazing gadget comes in! 

Legitimately acquired Titan memory crystals remember all the fancy swag you're holding or wearing, or dumping in bank storage, and every kind of moolah you could ever want to count. See it all with refurbished mechagnome holo-projectors (and a salvaged Kaheti shadecaster or two for that sweet purple loot). And when your shift is done and it's time for your warbuddy to clock in, totally safe supersonic rocket boosters zip it right to wherever they are, so they can know all about your haul.

Plus: With spare parts from official bank machinery (certified by the Undermine Cartels, the Stormwind Counting House, and the Silvermoon Treasury), it's easy to use, and easy to keep compatible as those systems change!
